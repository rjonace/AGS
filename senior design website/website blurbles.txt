Project Description 
	Auto-Grading system is a web based service that allows professors to create assignments, upload them, and display them to their students. Students can then complete the assignments, upload them, and receive instant feedback for their submission. This automatic feedback will help significantly reduce the workload for professors and TAs, allowing them to focus on things more conducive to helping students learn.
